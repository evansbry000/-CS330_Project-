Lock and Unlock Software
By Bryan Evans

Description
This program accepts a user input of integers that will provide a lock or unlock case when the correct input of my six digit
code is inputed for either one. It was programmed on Eclipse IDE. It can take the inputs of either multiple digits at the same time or
 one digit at a time.

Memo
My program contains several different objects, including an arraylist and an array. The array is designed to comb through the arraylist 
one at a time like a queue data structure: first in, first out. If only one integer is inputed, it steps one integer at a time. But if 
a larger integer of multiple digits is inputed, it will read through the number of digits until it reaches the end. The program is coded
in Java.
